				Evan has wonderful communication skills. When it comes to technology, he has the ability to determine the level of knowledge of his customer and break it down to terms that are easily understood. As the person daily working with the web applications that Evan created, I found him to be very skilled at discussing my needs for the application and incorporating them into the finished product. I think that is an amazing quality as there were times I didn't even know what I needed until it showed up in the application and made my daily work easier.
