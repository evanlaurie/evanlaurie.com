			For the last 6 years I have worked as a web application developer with focus on user experience. I strive to develop elegant, simplistic, and minimalistic user interfaces from conception to implementation with pixel-perfection. I currently work for the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation with the University of Washington where my primary responsibility is creating interactive data visualizations to visualize trends in public health data.</p>
		<p>I graduated from The Evergreen State College in 2010 with a degree in Computer Science. During my last three years I was working for the college Residential and Dining Services creating professional web applications. I worked on over a dozen web application projects including two mission critical applications for room management and incident tracking.</p>
		<p>I started creating websites in 2003 for my high school web development class. I find building web sites from scratch greatly satisfying. I enjoy the challenges and problem solving that web design brings and continue to learn something new everyday.</p>
